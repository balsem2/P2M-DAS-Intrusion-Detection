AI-based intrusion detection using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)
# DAS Intrusion Detection

This project focuses on intrusion detection using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)
and machine learning techniques.

## Objective
- Load and analyze DAS signals
- Classify events (walk, car, manipulation, etc.)
- Detect intrusion-related activities along the fiber

## Dataset
We use a public labeled DAS dataset (HDF5 format) from Scientific Data / Figshare.
Due to size constraints, raw data files are not included in this repository.

## Status
- [x] Repository created
- [ ] Dataset exploration
- [ ] Preprocessing
- [ ] Model training
